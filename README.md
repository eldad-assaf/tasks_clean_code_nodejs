# Full-Stack Task App (Flutter + NodeJS)

This project is a simple task management application developed to demonstrate clean code principles, basic UI design, and full-stack development using Flutter and NodeJS. The aim of this project is to showcase a clean code approach and a well-organized folder structure, making it an excellent resource for learning and understanding modern software development practices.

## Features and Technologies Used:

1. **Authentication with Node server (JWT):** Implemented secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for enhanced security.
2. **API Development and Deployment:** Developed robust APIs for the task app, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
3. **Error Handling in the Server Side:** Implemented effective error handling mechanisms on the server side to enhance the stability of the application.
4. **MongoDB + Mongoose:** Utilized MongoDB, a NoSQL database, along with Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, to manage the application's data.
5. **Postman:** Leveraged Postman for testing API endpoints and ensuring they function as intended.
6. **SwaggerUI:** Implemented SwaggerUI for interactive API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the APIs.
7. **Bloc:** Utilized the Bloc pattern for state management in the Flutter application, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and a reactive user interface.
8. **GetIt (Dependency Injection):** Implemented dependency injection using GetIt to manage and inject dependencies throughout the Flutter app, promoting modularity and testability.
9. **Dio (HTTP Calls):** Utilized Dio, a powerful HTTP client for Dart, to make efficient and reliable HTTP requests from the Flutter app to the backend server.

## Folder Structure:

The project follows a clean and organized folder structure, separating different aspects of the application for clarity and maintainability.

- **`/backend`:** Contains all the server-side code, including authentication, API routes, error handling, and database integration.
- **`/frontend`:** Contains the Flutter application code, including UI components, state management, and API integration.
- **`/docs`:** Includes documentation files, including API documentation generated using SwaggerUI.
- **`/postman`:** Contains Postman collections for testing API endpoints.
- **`/screenshots`:** Includes screenshots of the application for reference.

## Getting Started:

To get started with the Full-Stack Task App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url.git>
   ```

2. Set up the backend server by navigating to the `/backend` directory and following the instructions in the `README.md` file located there.

3. Set up the Flutter application by navigating to the `/frontend` directory and following the instructions in the `README.md` file located there.

4. Explore the documentation in the `/docs` folder to understand the API endpoints and how to interact with them.

5. Use the provided Postman collections in the `/postman` folder to test the API endpoints.
